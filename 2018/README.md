## Comments (Personal Opinion)
Highest quality contest among past National ACM-ICPC. The problem difficulty are appropriate and some are actually quite nice. There is **no** *problem* with confusing and misleading problem statement, weird problem, super low quality test data and *etc*.

It is great to see such improvement in my national ACM-ICPC contest. Hope that the contest quality can continue to improve in following years.
